# Bake assertions into images

## Node restrictions
  Using Node version: v0.10.0

  This restriction is because of the `openbadges-bakery` npm module we are using to bake the assertions into the images that relies on this older node version.

### Remote URL Testing
  Use https://localtunnel.me/ to assign a publicly available URL so the test urls can be reached by services like Mozilla Backpack or Badgr.io
